# N-Body Simulation

This program simulates our solar system in a 2D space. The planets are moving around the sun with their respective speed while the sun stays static at the center of the window. I wrote analgorithm to find the coordinates of the planets on the SFML window that uses a “normalization” ratio. The ratio consists of (window/2)/universeRadius which basically finds the proportion between the window and the universe’s radius. Then, I multiply this to the ratio to the x and y position which are still not “normalized” to the size of the window and then I add window size divided by 2 for both x and y because the planets start at the center of the screen and not at the top left corner. Then after setting the planet’s position, I made the planets move based on their mass, gravitational constant and distance. By doing so I had to calculate each vectoral force and acceleration and made the planets move counterclockwise around the sun. At the end of a given time it prints out the current state of each body in the solar system.
